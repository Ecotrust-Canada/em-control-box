Under normal circumstances, creating a new image is not necessary. It should be more efficient to copy an old one. However, in the event of a new image being needed, the process for creating one is documented here:

Steps to customize Ubuntu for the VMS:

1) Install XUbuntu Desktop (10.10 as of writing).
	1.1) Create a privileged user called "ecotrust"

3) customize the desktop:
	3.1) Create an unprivileged user called "user", requiring no password to log in.
        3.2) go to Applications -> System -> Login Screen. Auto-login the new user.
	3.3) Disable the screensaver. 
    3.4) Disable the desktop icons. xfce4-settings-manager -> desktop -> icons
    3.5) Disable monitor sleeping. xfce4-power-manager 

4) Install the VMS recording and monitoring software.
	4.5) Use git clone ssh://ecotrust.ca/var/git/vms_recording to unpack the VMS code
		to /usr/local/apps.
	4.6) "run" ./install.sh (as of writing, script has not been tested, but does document the required steps for image setup.)

5) Add init.d script and vms.conf
